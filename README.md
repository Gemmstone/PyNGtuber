# PyNGtuber
PNGtuber software made in Python, still in development

## Introduction

I've just started developing my own PNGtubing software, and I'm excited to make it open-source. This means it will be completely free, and I welcome contributions from the community to add new features and improve the codebase.

## Current Status Demo

## Future Plans

I have ambitious plans for the software, including:

- ~~An emotion selector that's completely independent of the model.~~
- ~~A clothing selector, also completely independent.~~
- ~~Animations for hair, tails, ears, and clothing.~~
- ~~Support for GIFs and PNGs.~~
- ~~Support for various assets, such as knives, controls, and more.~~
- ~~Changing expressions, clothing, assets, etc., via keyboard shortcuts or MIDI signals.~~
- ~~3 types of mouths: open, closed, and screaming.~~
- wow i just did all of these already lol, i still have some things i wanna add, i'll list them later

I'll continue to brainstorm and add more features while keeping the software as lightweight as possible.
