# PyNGtuber
PNGtuber software made in Python, still in development

## Introduction

I've just started developing my own PNGtubing software, and I'm excited to make it open-source. This means it will be completely free, and I welcome contributions from the community to add new features and improve the codebase.

## Current Status

At the moment, it's a simple application with a basic feature:
- A window that lists assets to use (work in progress).

## Future Plans

I have ambitious plans for the software, including:

- An emotion selector that's completely independent of the model.
- A clothing selector, also completely independent.
- Animations for hair, tails, ears, and clothing.
- Support for GIFs and PNGs.
- Support for various assets, such as knives, controls, and more.
- Changing expressions, clothing, assets, etc., via keyboard shortcuts or MIDI signals.
- 3 types of mouths: open, closed, and screaming.

I'll continue to brainstorm and add more features while keeping the software as lightweight as possible.
